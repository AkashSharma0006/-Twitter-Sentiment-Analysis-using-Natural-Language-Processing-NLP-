# üê¶ Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes & NLP

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Naive Bayes classifier**. The final model is deployed as a user-friendly web app using **Streamlit**, where users can enter tweets and get real-time sentiment predictions.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [Sentiment140 Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- **Size:** 1.6 million tweets
- **Target classes:**  
  - `0` = Negative  
  - `2` = Neutral  
  - `4` = Positive  

> The target labels were converted to:
- `0` = Negative  
- `1` = Positive  
- (Neutral class was removed in preprocessing for binary classification)
